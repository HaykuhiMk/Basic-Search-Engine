# Basic Search Engine

This project implements a simple text-based search engine using Python. It indexes text files and allows users to search for words within those files, displaying the relevance based on the frequency of occurrence. The search engine mimics a basic search functionality by indexing files in a specified folder and then allowing users to search for words in those files.
